The search algorithm is given, based on the search for "Tent". Therefore the html format of other data pertaining to other searches may not be the same, and will throw an error. Implemented a try: clause for error, should dispute search and return for another input.

Following further look over the code and other similar work found online, I realize my work may be lacking in some more professional and practical ways. 
I will happily take advice/critiques.
